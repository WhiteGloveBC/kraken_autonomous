# ASZA - Lessons Learned & Enforcement Summary

## 1. Simplicity Is Everything
- Most failures came from complexity, not logic.
- Black-box subprocesses, silent errors, and config sprawl were major pain points.
- Solution: all ASZA modules must log, wrap, and reflect visibly.

## 2. Every File Must Be Modular, Predictable, and Traceable

| Pattern            | Enforced? | How Enforced                        |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| 10-line max logic  | ✅         | Auto-splits via module_factory      |
| Reflection logs    | ✅         | `reflect()` required in template    |
| Execution wrapper  | ✅         | `@wrap_execution` mandatory         |
| Final log signal   | ✅         | `finalize()` from `template_footer` |
| Environment loading| ✅         | via `env_loader` + `template_header` |
| CLI args w/default | ✅         | `get_arg()` from header enforced    |

These are now scaffolded by default in all tools.

## 3. Push, Logs, and API Must Always Reflect State
- `git_pusher.py` upgraded to reflect success/failure
- `wrap_execution` added to catch and reflect errors
- GPT, LLM API clients, and even system scripts must emit feedback

## 4. Every Tool Will Be Replaceable
ASZA modules:
- Are short
- Fully wrapped
- Environment-aware
- Instantly regenerable

This means tools are **disposable and self-healing**, if built properly.

## 5. Automation Without Control Fails
GPT-based generation often fails without:
- Reflection of errors
- Modular generation
- Reusable patterns

ASZA fixes that via:
- Shared wrappers
- Templates
- Auto-reflecting modules
- Logging, wrapping, and enforcing patterns on creation

## 6. Future Enforcement Targets

| Target Area         | Enforcement Needed        | Status |
|---------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| Legacy tools        | Must rewrap + reflect     | Architect will handle |
| File generator      | Must use ASZA patterns    | TODO |
| GPT code generation | Auto-wrap, auto-finalize  | Enforced |
| Workflow chains     | Must reflect all progress | In progress |
| System setup tools  | Need final reflection     | Scheduled |

## Final Reflection

ASZA is now:
- Modular  
- Traceable  
- Recoverable  
- Upgradeable  
- Reflection-first  
- Architect-ready

We’ve moved from writing software to writing systems that write software.
